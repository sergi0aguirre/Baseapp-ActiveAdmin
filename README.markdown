Welcome to the Baseapp-ActiveAdmin wiki!


This is an application that merges two powerful tools,  [Baseapp](https://github.com/renderedtext/base-app ) and [ActiveAdmin](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin). As we know Baseapp provides a simple app with signup ,  login , login with facebook, user settings section, an so on. In the other hand we have ActiveAdmin, that is a cool interface for the administration area, with a single command we can have the full CRUD for any model in our app. Both tools are strongly open and we can easyly customize everything.


So merging these tools could give us an app running in a few minutes.
